# Desktop hackintosh with OpenCore

### Status: Maintenance

Compatibility is great, as the hardware closely resembles that of iMac 18,3. Onboard audio isn't configured, since I use a USB DAC. I don't have a wireless card attached, so AirDrop, Continuity, Handoff and other similar features are not working.

Currently running:

| Component      | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| macOS Catalina | 10.15.4 |
| OpenCore       | 0.5.8   |
